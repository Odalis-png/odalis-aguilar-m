                    My name is Odalis Aguilar, and art and design have always been part of my life. <br>
                    As a kid during the drives back home from either shopping or traveling to lakes, looking at the signs and admiring the colors and type, I would always try and recreate slab serifs so my work would look different compared to everyone else's. Later on, this influenced me to attend a visual arts high school, which introduced me to graphic design and how fundamental it is. Now, entering my final year at Lesley, I have developed this love and passion for design that keeps me always wanting to learn more.
